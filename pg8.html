    <div id="weirdtext">
        <p>
            Silently, I dressed, took leave of myself in the mirror, went down the stairs, sneaked a look at the quiet street, and went out. The station was not far from my house, but I thought it more prudent to take a cab. I told myself that I thus ran less chance of being recognized. The truth is that, in the deserted street, I felt infinitely visible and vulnerable. I recall that I told the driver to stop short of the main entrance. I got out with a painful and deliberate slowness. The train crept along gently, amid ash trees. It slowed down and stopped, almost in the middle of a field. No one called the name of a station. "Ashgrove?" I asked some children on the platform. "Ashgrove," they replied.

        var newtext = '';

        for (var i = 0; i < len; i++) {
          var currentchar = rawtxt.charAt(i);
          if (currentchar == ' ') {
            var newchar = '<span class="space"></span>';
          } else {
            var rng = Math.floor(Math.random() * 5) + 1;
            var newchar = '<span class="effect' + rng + '">' + currentchar + '</span>';
